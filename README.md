                                                            Abstract
                                                               
It is a question-and-answer site where questions are asked, answered, edited and organized by its community of users. It requires users to register with their real names rather than an Internet pseudonym (screen name), and visitors unwilling to log in or use cookies have had to resort to workarounds to use the site. They can up vote or down vote answers, and suggest edits to extant answers provided by other users. It community includes some well-known people.
The topics that are popular typically reflect the kinds of information that people are looking for. We think there’s a lot of knowledge that is still in people’s heads that hasn’t really been written down on the internet in a useful format, including their real names, to search engines.
The layout of the site is very similar to Facebook and Twitter, which D’Angelo believes is intentional. “I think if you see similarities to Facebook, a lot of it has to do with the fact that we’re both building products that people use with their friends. User must provide their real names to both ask and answer questions. “We’re focused on getting really high quality answers, and we’re really just trying to build a high quality knowledge base over time. People contribute to that by adding whatever knowledge they have and things they know about better than other people. Users can vote on the answer they believe is best and search for questions before they ask one. We try hard to avoid duplicate questions. If you’re someone who’s going to come along and write an answer, we want there to be only one place for you to write that answer
